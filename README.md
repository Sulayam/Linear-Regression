Linear Regression on Salary Data
This repository contains a project that applies linear regression to analyze and predict the salary of employees in a multinational corporation (MNC). The project leverages Python and its data science libraries to build a predictive model that estimates employee salaries based on various features.

Project Features:
Data Collection:

Utilized a dataset containing information about employees, including their salary and other relevant features such as years of experience, education level, job role, and more.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing data to ensure a complete dataset.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Converted categorical features into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Standardized features to ensure they contribute equally to the model's performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Computed summary statistics to understand the data distribution.
Visualizations: Created plots such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to visualize relationships between features and salary.
Model Building:

Linear Regression Model: Implemented a linear regression model using Python's scikit-learn library.
Model Training: Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset to learn the relationships between features and salary.
Model Evaluation:

Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.
Residual Analysis: Analyzed residuals to check the model's assumptions and identify potential areas for improvement.
Documentation:

Jupyter Notebooks: Provided detailed Jupyter notebooks with code and explanations for each step of the process.
README Files: Included instructions on how to run the project and interpret the results.
Usage:
This project demonstrates how linear regression can be applied to predict employee salaries based on various features. It serves as a practical example of using Python for data analysis and machine learning, providing insights into the relationships between different factors and employee compensation.
